    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There are as many takes on jerk chicken in Jamaica as there are cooks on the island, but most share the same method: Chicken is coated in a seasoning mixture dominated by spices and chiles, then grilled. This version comes from Paul Chung, a self-taught cook of Chinese and Jamaican descent who worked in the mail room at Food & Wine. It's wonderfully spicy, smoky, and fragrant â€” everything you want jerk chicken to be. But what puts this one above all others? The key is including Chinese five-spice in the marinade: "This spark of cinnamon enhances the rich clove flavor imparted by the allspice berries," former F&W Test Kitchen Supervisor Marcia Kiesel wrote. For best results, let the chicken marinate overnight, so the seasoning has time to thoroughly penetrate the meat. The chicken can also be roasted in the oven if desired.</p>
