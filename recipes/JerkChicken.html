    <h1>Jerk Chicken</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There are as many takes on jerk chicken in Jamaica as there are cooks on the island, but most share the same method: Chicken is coated in a seasoning mixture dominated by spices and chiles, then grilled. This version comes from Paul Chung, a self-taught cook of Chinese and Jamaican descent who worked in the mail room at Food & Wine. It's wonderfully spicy, smoky, and fragrant â€” everything you want jerk chicken to be. But what puts this one above all others? The key is including Chinese five-spice in the marinade.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 Scotch bonnet chiles, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon five-spice powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon allspice berries, coarsely ground</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarsely ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Two 2.5- to 4-pound chickens, quartered</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the onion, scallions, chiles, garlic, five-spice powder, allspice, pepper, thyme, nutmeg and salt; process to a coarse paste. With the machine on, add the the soy sauce and oil in a steady stream. Pour the marinade into a large, shallow dish, add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Bring the chicken to room temperature before proceeding.</li>
        <li>Light a grill. Grill the chicken over a medium-hot fire, turning occasionally, until well browned and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes. (Cover the grill for a smokier flavor.) Transfer the chicken to a platter and serve.</li>
    </ol>
